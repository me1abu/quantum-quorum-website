    <h2>The Carnot cycle when acting as a heat engine consists of the following steps:</h2>
    <p>3. <bold> Reversible isothermal compression of the gas at the "cold" temperature, TC (isothermal heat rejection)</bold> (C to D). Now the gas is exposed to the cold temperature reservoir while the surroundings do work on the gas by compressing it (such as through the return compression of a piston), while causing an amount of waste heat QC < 0 (with the standard sign convention for heat) and of entropy ΔSC = QC/TC < 0 <br>to flow out of the gas to the low temperature reservoir. (In magnitude, this is the same amount of entropy absorbed in step 1. The entropy decreases in isothermal compression since the multiplicity of the system decreases with the volume.) In terms of magnitude, the recompression work performed by the surroundings in this step is less than the work performed on the surroundings in step 1 because it occurs at a lower pressure due to the lower temperature (i.e. the resistance to compression is lower under step 3 than the force of expansion under step 1). We can refer to the first law of thermodynamics to explain this behavior: <br>ΔU= W+Q .</p>
