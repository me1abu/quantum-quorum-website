    <h2>The Carnot cycle when acting as a heat engine consists of the following steps:</h2>
    <p>4. <bold> Isentropic compression of the gas (isentropic work input)</bold> (D to A). Once again the piston and cylinder are assumed to be thermally insulated and the cold temperature reservoir is removed. During this step, the surroundings continue to do work to further compress the gas and both the temperature and pressure rise now that the heat sink has been removed. This additional work increases the internal energy of the gas, compressing it and causing the temperature to rise to TH. The entropy remains unchanged. At this point the gas is in the same state as at the start of step 1.</p>
