    <h2>The Carnot cycle when acting as a heat engine consists of the following steps:</h2>
    <p>1. <bold>Reversible isothermal expansion of the gas at the "hot" temperature, TH (isothermal heat addition or absorption)</bold>. During this step (A to B) the gas is allowed to expand and it does work on the surroundings. The temperature of the gas (the system) does not change during the process, and thus the expansion is isothermic. The gas expansion is propelled by absorption of heat energy QH and of entropy Î”SH = QH / TH from the high temperature reservoir.</p>
