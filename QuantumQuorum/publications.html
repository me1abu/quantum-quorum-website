                        <p class="articletext">Narinder Singh Kapany (1926-2020), known as the 'Father of Fiber Optics,' was a pioneering scientist born in Punjab. After studying in Dehradun and Agra University, he moved to London for a Ph.D. at Imperial College, where he achieved a breakthrough in transmitting images through optical fibers in 1953. His work in fiber optics led to over 120 patents and significant advances in communications, biomedical instrumentation, solar energy, and more.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="articletext">Kapany's entrepreneurial efforts included founding Optics Technology Inc. in 1960, taking it public in 1967, and later starting Kaptron Inc., which he sold to AMP Incorporated. He continued influencing the field with K2 Optronics and served on multiple boards, gaining global business recognition.</p>

                        <p class="articletext">Sir Kariamanikkam Srinivasa Krishnan (4 December 1898 - 14 June 1961) was a co-discoverer of Raman scattering, for which his mentor C. V. Raman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1930. He was born in a Vaishnavite brahmin family on 4 December 1898 in Watrap (Tamil Nadu). He had his early education in Hindu Higher Secondary school, in Watrap, after which he attended the American College in Madurai and the Madras Christian College. After gaining his degree in Physics he became a demonstrator in chemistry.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="articletext">K. S. Krishnan joined C. V. Raman in 1920 at the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, Kolkata, focusing on light scattering experiments. He significantly contributed to the discovery of the Raman Effect, which explains energy changes in scattered photons, aiding material analysis. Between 1925 and 1928, Krishnan authored 16 papers under Raman's guidance and conducted crucial experiments demonstrating inelastic light scattering. He first demonstrated the scattering effect to Raman, leading to their joint discovery of the Raman Effect on February 28, now celebrated as National Science Day.</p>

                        <p class="articletext">Satyendra Nath Bose (1894 - 1974) was a renowned Indian physicist and mathematician whose work with Albert Einstein led to Bose-Einstein statistics and the prediction of Bose-Einstein condensation, a revolutionary state of matter.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="articletext">Bose was a brilliant student at Calcutta University but faced early job rejections for being overqualified. In 1916, he joined the Physics Department at Calcutta University as a lecturer, where he collaborated with Meghnad Saha. Despite limited resources, they made significant contributions to modern physics, including translating Einstein's works on relativity into English.</p>

                        <p class="articletext">Sir Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar (21 February 1894 - 1 January 1955) was an Indian colloid chemist, academic and scientific administrator. The first director-general of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Bhatnagar is revered as the Father of Research Laboratories in India. He was also the first Chairman of the University Grants Commission (UGC). He was born in Bhera, Shahpur in a Hindu Kayastha family. Bhatnagar completed his elementary education at Dayanand Anglo-Vedic High School, Sikandrabad. He passed the Punjab University's Intermediate Examination in 1913 and graduated from Forman Christian College with a BSc in Physics and MSc in Chemistry.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="articletext">He earned his Doctorate in Science in 1921. Dr. Bhatnagar solved the issue of mud hardening during drilling in saline water by applying colloidal chemistry. He added Indian gum, which lowered the mud suspension's viscosity while enhancing its stability against electrolyte-induced flocculation. His research covered emulsions, colloids, and industrial chemistry, with key contributions in magneto-chemistry for studying chemical reactions. </p>

                        <p class="articletext">Rajeshwari Chatterjee (24 January 1922 - 3 September 2010) was an Indian scientist and an academician. She was the first woman engineer from Karnataka and described herself as an engineering-scientist. During her tenure at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, Chatterjee was a professor and later chairperson of the department of Electrical Communication Engineering. She had her primary education in a "special English school" founded by her grandmother, Kamalamma Dasappa, one of the first women graduates from Mysore and who was very active in the field of education, especially for widows and deserted wives.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="articletext">She studied in Central College of Bangalore and earned B.Sc. (Hons) and M.Sc. degrees in mathematics. In 1943, after her M.Sc., Chatterjee joined the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore as a Research Student in the then Electrical Technology Department in the area of Communication. After obtaining a master's degree in electrical engineering in the US, Chatterjee completed her PhD at the University of Michigan in 1953, aged 31. Her supervisor was Professor William Gould. Dow, a pioneer in electrical engineering who had helped develop life-saving radar jamming technology during the war.</p>
