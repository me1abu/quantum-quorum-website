    <p><bold>Newton's laws of motion</bold> are three physical laws that describe the relationship between the motion of an object and the forces acting on it. These laws, which provide the basis for <bold> Newtonian mechanics</bold>, can be paraphrased as follows: <br>
        <ol>
         <li>A body remains at rest, or in motion at a constant speed in a straight line, except insofar as it is acted upon by a force.</li>

         <li>At any instant of time, the net force on a body is equal to the rate at which the body's momentum is changing with time.</li>
         <li>If two bodies exert forces on each other, these forces have the same magnitude but opposite directions</li></ol></p>
